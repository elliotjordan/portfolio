  <h1 style="font-family: Arial; text-align: center;">Here are some samples from my work at University of Wisconsin - Extension<h1>
	<h3 style="font-family: Arial; text-align: center;">My role at UWEX included instructional design, instructional application support, and course support. 
</h3>
  <p style="text-align: center; padding: 0 60px 0 60px">While this section has no visuals, I want to describe that my remote role here at UWEX included doing a lot of technical product research and documentation for instructional technology applications, faculty support, and creating documentation. One project that we focused on specifically was for the Canvas LMS and involved several features they were introducung that caused a lot of controversy and discussion on various forums. We monitored and participated in those discussions and tried to help improve the Canvas LMS in several areas of functionality.</p>
